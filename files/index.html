    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Ward Abd-Alrazeq, a passionate computer engineering graduate with a focus on frontend development.
      Proficient in Vue.js, I specialize in crafting engaging user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With
      experience in the Tailwind CSS framework, I create simple yet visually appealing designs that captivate users.

      collaboration and version control through GitHub. I am committed to continuous growth, enhancing communication,
      learning new languages, and fostering strong teamwork skills.</p>
